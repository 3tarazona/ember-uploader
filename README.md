## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.

Ember Uploader uses [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) for builds and tests while using [bower](http://bower.io/) for dependency management. You will need to have these tools installed if you would like to build Ember Uploader.

To get started with development simply do a `npm install` inside the cloned repository to install all dependencies needed for running [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/). You will also need to run `bower install` to install the runtime dependencies. Afterwards you can do a simple `grunt` to execute the default task which will  build the library.

Lint and test your code using: `grunt test`.

_Also, please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the "packages/ember-uploader/lib" subdirectory; tests are located in "packages/ember-uploader/tests"!_
